# this telling the mlflow that we want to save all the artifacts
# and metadata in a sqlite which is one of the alternatives of the backend stroe
mlflow ui --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow.db


# To launch an MLflow tracking server on your local machine, you need to follow these steps:

1. Create necessary directories: Create directories for your SQLite database and artifact storage.

mkdir -p /path/to/mlflow/artifacts
touch /path/to/mlflow/mlflow.db

2. Launch the MLflow tracking server: You can launch the server using the following command, configuring the backend store to use SQLite and the artifact store to use a local directory.
mlflow server \
    --backend-store-uri sqlite:///path/to/mlflow/mlflow.db \
    --default-artifact-root /path/to/mlflow/artifacts \
    --serve-artifacts
